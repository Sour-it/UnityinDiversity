										<b><i>All Humans, undertaking the most profound journey of our lives, for ensuring the full majesty of our true lives, as humans, beyond while integral with, all of our myriad cherished differences on Earth. A world in which the human agenda is front and center. A milieu in which each of us rejoices in our individuality while cherishing all our differences and diversity as fellow humans. An era in which everyone as humans agrees and shares interest in protecting our planet-and in achieving optimal prospects for all of its inhabitants. A world fellowship that embraces an ongoing, ever-unfolding conversation and inquiry-through and for each and all humans- on how to accomplish our highest shared priorities as humans. A home base from which all of our institutions and all of our cultural traditions connect affirmatively, serving to uplift all our horizons and -without even intending it-creating a network of reciprocal healing throughout the planet. A mutuality through which each of us becomes a benefactor as well as a beneficiary of humankind and the planet in which we all live. The Human Unity Project (HUP) has raised its horizon, dedication and agenda to such a vision of the world. And this human-focused agenda offers not only a forum, but sets in motion a uniquely practical process involving ongoing inquiry and discovery-a process that includes and profoundly benefits all humans. Key to the realization of human unity is a bedrock agreement already in place and already at least latently held by every human on Earth. This agreement is both so obvious and so easy to overlook, yet it can extinguish our conflicts and disclose the inherent majesty and wholeness of all our lives. It is even critical for saving planetary life and civilizations from extinction. The agreement is as simple-sounding as they come: We are all humans. However, far from being a platitude or tautology, the agreement that: "We are all humans" derives from the deep wellspring of our essence, and it is the binding force that creates human unity. At some level, each of us-every one of the 6.8 billion humans- has already "signed on" to that agreement, but only in a semiconscious or perfunctory way (similar to the way we sign on to the fine print on documents we don't care to read). But perhaps it's time we look closer at what we humans have essentially agreed to, for it has a virtually limitless bounty of significance.Incomparably obvious and important as it is, our human-focused agreement is almost invisible to us. And even when we are made aware of it, we fail to grasp its significance. How can this be? First, the word "human" itself has been subjected to a legacy of a spectrum of misunderstandings and misuse (explained below in the section "Humans As Humans"). Because of that misuse, the profound positive implications of the human have been closed off to examination. We are so habitually identified with our various secondary identities (as individuals, religions, nations, cultures), and the levels of seemingly intractable disagreement they engender, that the genuine possibility of an essential, underlying set of primary interests, priorities and agreement scarcely attracts our notice. Yet nothing is more exciting, more vibrant, or more practical than is our human-focused agreement in its capacity to safeguard and elevate our diverse identities, institutions and cultures for the highest good. Simply lifting our eyes, we can see and recognize our inherent identity as humans, allowing everyone and everything to blossom anew. Nothing can be a stronger catalyst toward fulfilling our lives than this recognition. It enables an undreamed-of level of exploration and celebration of our creative individuality and diversity. And it allows us to begin the stimulating and enchanting consummation of our lives as humans. </i></b>
