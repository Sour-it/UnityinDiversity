							"There lies before us, if we choose, continual progress in happiness, knowledge, and wisdom. Shall we, instead, choose death, because we cannot forget our quarrels? We appeal as human beings, to human beings: remember your humanity and forget the rest." -Bertrand Russell (1950 Nobel Laureate in Literature; philosopher, mathematician and writer) "The awareness that we are all human beings has become lost in war and through politics."  -Albert Schweitzer (1952 Nobel Peace Prize; medical missionary, theologian & musician in Africa)

							<p>The Human Unity Project has one immediate purpose in mind: to inquire into and build upon the universal foundation and empirical agreement of all our lives, that "we are all humans" -unveiling, catalyzing and actualizing ourselves to our highest aspirations. There appears to be no other project, or regimen for human possibility that offers a wider or deeper array of agreement, conversation, inquiry and practical applications for ensuring the security and wholeness for ourselves, for all of life, and for all our environments on Earth.  When we ground our lives in the awareness that we are all humans, we discover a source of fellowship that guides how we relate to everyone and everything else. We begin to truly see that as humans we have shared priorities that honor, complement and nurture the highest aspirations of ourselves as humans -and of all our differences as well. Indeed, discovering our humanness is like beholding a heretofore unexperienced familiarity with ourselves. It is like "coming home" for the first time. Further, we recognize that for all of us to feel and be totally secure and rise to our true wholeness, we must build on this empirical actuality and deepen and broaden this primary focus in our own lives and throughout the world we inhabit. As a first but crucial step toward realizing these goals, a remarkably small investment of dollars and resources is needed, in exchange for unprecedented, manifold returns. In the penultimate section below, titled "An Unparalleled Investment," we discuss in detail how your participation and support can make the crucial difference in everyone's future. Your involvement in this project (based on your own consideration and assessment) is crucial to its success. The World Public Forum -as a tax-deductible, public benefit association devoted solely to supporting the human at every level of our lives, everywhere on Earth -offers an incomparably sound way to make this a world in which all humans can survive and thrive to the utmost.When successes are achieved, we tend to attribute them to inexorable nonhuman forces -such as "technology" or "progress" or "science." But when failures occur, the word human often is pejoratively assigned: "human failing," "all too human," "human weakness." "human error," "I'm only human" and "subject to human nature" are often stated as the ultimate cause and excuse for the fate of our lives. Every human on Earth is diminished -if not tragically wasted -by these unwarranted misusages, which effectively deny  our humanness as the source of our greatest achievements, values and goals -indeed, of our apparent highest capacity for life itself. In order to reconnect with our fundamental nature and ground, we must begin to ask certain foundational questions: "What indeed is our nature? Why are we commonly called "human beings," rather than "humans"? Indeed, though we are humans, why do we not live as humans? What would our actual lives and world be like were we to live (as well as be) as humans? Could we as humans more effectively speak out to ensure a most responsible and fulfilled life and world?" <br>To live as humans is our prospect for living securely, successfully and wholly -in ways that ensure both our survival and fulfillment. To live at odds with and in dissociation from our most primary essence is to risk all of the failures and catastrophes that we could otherwise (as united, living humans) prevent. <br>Just how can we share the security and wholeness of all our lives and environments? We earnestly invite the most accomplished and caring  of you  out  there -thinkers,  designers, coordinators, investors, philanthropists the world over, as well as anyone else who wants to participate and to join in this quest for addressing the world's greatest challenges. We have sought  the framework set forth here.  It has achieved, certainly to date, an uncontested basis for such supremely practical achievement.
