											<center>"Through our scientific genius, we have made this world a neighborhood;  now,  through our moral and spiritual development, we must make of it a brotherhood." <br><b> -Martin Luther King Jr.</b><br>"The oneness of human beings is the basic ethical thread that holds us together . . . I am convinced that poor people are just as  human as anyone else. They have just as much potential as anyone."<br>"Deep within every human exists a precious treasure of initiative and creativity waiting to be discovered." <br><b> -Muhammad Yunus</b></center></p>

									<h3><center><i><u>R</u>eleasing Freedom, Dignity and Wholeness for All Humans</i></center></h3>
									<p>Toward forming a human world, the Human Unity Project has applied its human-grounded resources (such as human-focused agreement, inquiry and conversation) to a preliminary model of organization consisting of twenty-two Human Unity Coordinators, two from each of eleven regions of the world, approximately equal in population. This schema would allow for direct human-with-human relationship, communication and coordination at plenary meetings of the eleven regions, and interactive leader-public communication both throughout the world public and within each of the population regions. This schema (modified from consultations in 1979 with the psychologist Carl Rogers and scientist Jonas Salk) is proposed as a practical format facilitating an optimal number of individuals for coordinating global intercommunication. This model is considered in greater detail at the menu Invitation to Agreement: Human Coordination Initiative -Forming a Human World). The distinguished persons mentioned there (such as Walter Cronkite, Vaclav Havel, and His Holiness the Dalai Lama) are included only because of their status as exemplars to the world. They are widely known in their particular region of the world (and, generally, throughout the world), and they represent the types of individuals who would be included and appropriate as Human Unity Coordinators for the population regions.</p>
									<h3><center><i><u>V</u>isionary Benefactor of All Humans</h3></center></i>
									<p>A world of disagreement, if not discord, that we see all around us couldn't be more fateful, or its consequences more serious. If its own logic is unchallenged, a dystopian world nightmare could prove inevitable. But if we successfully expose it to the light of day, our futures can be bright beyond our wildest imagination. Throughout the world, people are desperately waiting for those of us who can to indeed do what we can -and what they by themselves cannot: to permit human unity to shine in every corner of the world, and on every individual human on Earth. Short of universally acknowledged human agreement, all of the efforts by the world's finest thinkers and leaders could fail us. As our technological age continues to enable ever cheaper and more catastrophic means and scenarios of killing and destruction, none of our lives will be secure until our highest aspirations as humans are assured through our combined efforts.

										<h3><a href="#">The World's Greatest Investment</a></h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Isn't it a no-brainer that we must invest in the present and future life of ourselves and our loved ones? But unless we have an economically and humanly hospitable world, we will have no future in which to invest. If a single practical investment of dollars or resources could simultaneously optimize everyone's security as well as quality of life on a global scale, would we choose to make such an investment? The Human Unity Project (HUP) creates a underlying milieu serving to inspire and nurture all of the highest endeavors of all of our organizations, initiatives and activities. An investment in the Human Unity Project, therefore, is also an investment in all the countless and diverse organizations, institutions and practical measures that can make the critical difference between an unlivable world and a world of undreamed-of security and possibility.
